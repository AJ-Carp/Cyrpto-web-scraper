# Introduction
For this project, I created an automated web scraper that collects the price of Bitcoin and the time it is scraped from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). Its automated becauase I used the time module to make it pull data every 10 seconds. 

Check out the [code](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.py) and [excel file](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Auto%20Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.csv)!!
