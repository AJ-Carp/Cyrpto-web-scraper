# Introduction
For this I project I created an automated web scraper that collects data regarding the price of Bitcoin. This auto scraper collects data from coinmarketcap.com every 10 seconds. 

Check out the [code](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.py) and [excel file](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Auto%20Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.csv)!!
