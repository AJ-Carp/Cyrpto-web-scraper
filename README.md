# Introduction
For this I project I created an automated web scraper that collects data on the price of Bitcoin. Every 10 seconds this auto scraper collects data from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/).

Check out the [code](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.py) and [excel file](https://github.com/AJ-Carp/Cyrpto-web-scraper/blob/main/Auto%20Crypto%20Web%20Scraper.csv)!!
